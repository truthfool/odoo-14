OpenG2P
=======

The “OpenG2P” framework is a set of building blocks based on revamped versions of digital tools employed by the Government of Sierra Leone to pay 30,000 ebola frontline and health workers at the height of the West African Ebola Crisis.
Opensourcing these provide other programs with an easily extensible baseline offering out-of-the-box solutions to problems that the ebola response encountered and incorporates key lessons from the Sierra Leone Ebola payment case.

OpenG2P is built on excellent existing opensource software with large developer and user communities e.g. Odoo for the ERP layer and Elasticsearch for the search layer and ready to use in environments like local infrastructure or a highly scalable cloud environment.
